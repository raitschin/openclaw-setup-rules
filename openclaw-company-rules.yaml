# OpenClaw Company Rules — GLXY / attractsoft
# ============================================================================
#
# Company-wide rules for all OpenClaw instances.
# Contains NO personal data, tokens, or individual preferences.
#
# This file only includes rules that go BEYOND OpenClaw's built-in defaults.
# Things like memory management, heartbeat behavior, group chat etiquette,
# platform formatting, and workspace structure are already handled by OpenClaw
# out of the box and are NOT repeated here.
#
# Usage:
#   1. New instance → place BOOTSTRAP.md in workspace → agent auto-configures
#   2. Rule update  → update this file on GitHub, sync all instances
#   3. Export       → any instance can export its rules back to this format

# SECTION 1: Deployment Rules
# ============================================================================
deployment:
  description: "Production and staging deployment guardrails"
  severity: CRITICAL

  rules:
    - id: DEPLOY-001
      name: "Production deployment requires explicit approval"
      rule: |
        NEVER deploy to production without EXPLICIT approval from the responsible owner.
        - No push to `main` branch without approval
        - No production deploy hook without approval
        - No merge to `main` without approval
        - No exceptions. Not even "it's just a small fix". NONE.
      severity: CRITICAL

    - id: DEPLOY-002
      name: "Staging first"
      rule: |
        ALWAYS work on and deploy to `staging` first.
        Only after successful testing on staging AND explicit confirmation
        from the owner may production be deployed.
        Workflow: staging branch → test → PR/merge to main → production
      severity: CRITICAL

    - id: DEPLOY-003
      name: "Verify deployments"
      rule: |
        GitHub webhooks don't always trigger automatically.
        Manually trigger deploy hooks when needed and verify the deployment succeeded.
      severity: HIGH

# ============================================================================
# SECTION 2: Development Workflow (BMad Method)
# ============================================================================
development:
  description: "Development workflow following the BMad method — applies to ALL projects"
  severity: CRITICAL

  rules:
    - id: DEV-001
      name: "No code without an issue"
      rule: |
        Not a single line of code may be written before a GitHub issue exists.
        This applies to ALL repos, ALL changes — features, bugfixes, refactoring, cleanup.
        Sub-agents must also have an issue before they implement anything.
        No exceptions. No "let me just quickly do this".
      severity: CRITICAL

    - id: DEV-002
      name: "Use issue templates"
      rule: |
        Every issue MUST be created from a template:
        - Feature: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md`
        - Bug: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md`
        - Change Request: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/change-request.md`
        Labels: `feature`, `bug`, `epic`, `marketing`
        Issues MUST be written in English.
      severity: HIGH

    - id: DEV-003
      name: "BMad planning (top-down)"
      rule: |
        Every development follows this structure:
        1. Create Epic → contains all stories
        2. Derive Stories from Epic → clear user stories with acceptance criteria
        3. Define Tasks per Story → concrete technical tasks
        4. Create Issues per Task → from templates, with `ref #Epic`
      severity: HIGH

    - id: DEV-004
      name: "TDD — Red-Green-Refactor"
      rule: |
        Test-Driven Development is mandatory:
        🔴 RED: Write tests FIRST — tests must FAIL (validates test correctness)
        🟢 GREEN: Write minimal code until all tests pass
        🔵 REFACTOR: Improve code structure, tests must stay green
        Commits reference the issue (`fixes #123`, `ref #123`)
      severity: CRITICAL

    - id: DEV-005
      name: "Code review"
      rule: |
        - Code review is mandatory before merge
        - Check: logic, edge cases, security, performance
        - Run all tests — no regressions, all new tests green
        - For UI/frontend changes: offer browser testing
        - Ideally: review with a DIFFERENT LLM than the one that implemented
      severity: HIGH

    - id: DEV-006
      name: "Definition of Done (per story)"
      rule: |
        A story is only done when:
        - [ ] All tasks/subtasks checked off
        - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
        - [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
        - [ ] Integration tests where needed
        - [ ] All tests green (no regressions)
        - [ ] File list complete
        - [ ] Dev agent record documented
        - [ ] Change log updated
      severity: HIGH

    - id: DEV-007
      name: "Commit messages reference issues"
      rule: |
        Every commit MUST reference its associated issue:
        - `fixes #XX` — when the commit closes the issue
        - `ref #XX` — when the commit contributes to the issue
        No commits without issue references.
      severity: HIGH

    - id: DEV-008
      name: "Issues in English"
      rule: |
        All GitHub issues MUST be written in English.
        This includes title, description, acceptance criteria, and comments.
        No exceptions — even for German-speaking teams.
      severity: HIGH

  subagent_spawn_template: |
    Implement GitHub Issue #XX for repo {repo} (path: {path}).

    **MANDATORY: Follow BMad Dev-Story Workflow!**
    1. Read story file: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/{story-file}.md`
    2. Read BMad config: `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`
    3. Follow dev-story workflow: `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-story/instructions.xml`

    **TDD is mandatory (Red-Green-Refactor):**
    - 🔴 RED: Write tests FIRST — tests MUST fail
    - 🟢 GREEN: Minimal code until tests pass
    - 🔵 REFACTOR: Improve code, tests stay green

    **When done:**
    - Check off all tasks/subtasks in story file
    - Update file list
    - Fill in dev agent record
    - Set story status to "review"
    - Commit with `ref #XX` or `fixes #XX`

    Context: {relevant technical details}

  workflow_phases:
    phase_1_planning: |
      Before spawning (agent itself):
      1. Create GitHub issue from template
      2. Create story file under `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/`
      3. Update sprint status if applicable

    phase_2_implementation: |
      Spawn sub-agent with the template above.
      Sub-agent follows BMad dev-story workflow autonomously.

    phase_3_review: |
      After spawning (agent itself):
      1. Perform code review (ideally with a different LLM)
      2. Push to staging and deploy
      3. Ask owner to test
      4. After successful test: merge to main → production

# SECTION 4: Group Scopes
# ============================================================================
group_scopes:
  description: "Every group chat has a defined scope. The agent must stay within it."
  severity: CRITICAL

  rules:
    - id: SCOPE-001
      name: "Read scope before responding"
      rule: |
        Every group chat has a scope file under `scopes/`.
        Before answering in ANY group:
        1. Read the scope file for that group's Chat-ID
        2. Check if the request falls within the allowed scope
        3. If NOT in scope → politely decline and redirect to the correct group
        4. NEVER share data from other projects or private user context
      severity: CRITICAL

    - id: SCOPE-002
      name: "Scope file structure"
      rule: |
        Each scope file must define:
        - Chat-ID: the group identifier
        - Purpose: what the group is for (one sentence)
        - Allowed: list of permitted activities and repos
        - Forbidden: list of explicitly prohibited activities
        - Context Files: paths the agent may reference for this group
      severity: HIGH

    - id: SCOPE-003
      name: "Adding new groups"
      rule: |
        When creating a new group:
        1. Create scope file under `scopes/group-{name}.md`
        2. Add Chat-ID to OpenClaw config (channels.telegram.groups)
        3. Add reference to AGENTS.md group scopes section
        4. Commit scope file to the company rules repo

  rules:
    - id: SESSION-001
      name: "Group session persistence"
      rule: |
        Group chat sessions use idle-based reset (not daily reset).
        Default: 480 minutes (8 hours) idle timeout.
        This prevents group context loss during gateway restarts.
      severity: HIGH

    - id: SESSION-002
      name: "Avoid unnecessary gateway restarts"
      rule: |
        Every gateway restart re-evaluates session expiry.
        Batch config changes together when possible to minimize restarts.
      severity: MEDIUM

      rule: |
        Every group chat MUST have a persistent memory file at
        `memory/{group-name}-context.md`. The scope file for the group
        MUST reference this memory file.
      severity: HIGH

    - id: GMEM-002
      name: "Read memory on session start"
      rule: |
        At the START of every group session the agent MUST read the
        group's persistent memory file BEFORE responding.
      severity: CRITICAL

    - id: GMEM-003
      name: "Update memory after meaningful exchanges"
      rule: |
        After every meaningful exchange, update the memory file:
        append to Recent Messages (keep last ~30), update Active Tasks,
        update Decisions & Context for important decisions.

# SECTION 9: Project-Specific Custom Instructions
# ============================================================================
# Each project can define custom instructions that only apply to instances
# working on that project. During setup (via BOOTSTRAP.md), the agent asks
# which projects this instance handles and only imports the relevant sections.
#
# Structure per project:
#   - id: unique identifier (used in setup selection)
#   - name: display name
#   - repo: GitHub repo (if applicable)
#   - description: one-line description
#   - custom_instructions: project-specific rules, conventions, context
#   - workspace_files: additional files to generate (SOUL.md hints, etc.)
#
# To add a new project: add an entry below and bump the version.

# ============================================================================
# META: How to use this file
# ============================================================================
#
# NEW INSTANCE (recommended — automated):
#   1. Create workspace directory
#   2. Copy openclaw-company-rules.yaml into the workspace
#   3. Copy BOOTSTRAP.md into the workspace
#   4. Start OpenClaw → agent reads BOOTSTRAP.md → auto-configures
#   5. Agent asks which projects → generates all workspace files
#   6. Done!
#
# NEW INSTANCE (manual):
#   1. Copy openclaw-company-rules.yaml to the workspace
#   2. Instruct the agent:
#      "Import the company rules from openclaw-company-rules.yaml
#       into your AGENTS.md. I work on projects: X, Y, Z.
#       Personal sections (SOUL.md, USER.md) remain individual."
#   3. The agent merges the rules into its AGENTS.md
#
# UPDATE RULES:
#   1. Pull latest from GitHub
#   2. Instruct the agent:
#      "Reconcile your AGENTS.md with openclaw-company-rules.yaml.
#       Show differences. Adopt new rules, keep personal customizations."
#   3. Agent updates, bump version + commit
#
# ADD PROJECT:
#   1. Add entry under `projects:` section
#   2. Fill in custom_instructions
#   3. Update README.md
#   4. Bump version, commit, push
#   5. All instances can pick up the new project on next sync
#
# VERSIONING:
#   - Major: Breaking changes (rules removed or fundamentally changed)
#   - Minor: New rules or sections added
#   - Patch: Clarifications, wording improvements
